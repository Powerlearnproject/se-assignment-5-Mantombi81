The website should automatically detect your operating system (Windows) and provide the download link for the stable build. If not, ensure to select the correct operating system (Windows) from the dropdown menu.
Run the Visual Studio Code Installer:

Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded installer file (VSCodeSetup.exe).
Double-click on the installer file to launch it. Windows may ask for confirmation to run the installer, click "Yes" or provide administrative credentials if prompted.
Install Visual Studio Code:

The installer will open the Visual Studio Code Setup Wizard.
Click on "Next" to proceed with the installation.
Accept License Agreement:

Read the license agreement carefully.
Check the box "I accept the agreement" and click "Next".
Choose Installation Options:

Select the destination folder where you want to install Visual Studio Code. The default location (C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code) is recommended.
Optionally, you can choose whether to add Visual Studio Code to the PATH for easier command-line access.
Click "Next" to continue.
Select Additional Tasks (Optional):

Choose any additional tasks you want to perform during installation, such as creating a desktop shortcut or adding to the context menu.
Click "Next".
Install:

Click on the "Install" button to begin the installation process.
Visual Studio Code will now be installed on your Windows 11 system. The process may take a few moments.
Complete the Installation:

Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to exit the setup wizard.
Launch Visual Studio Code:

After installation, you can launch Visual Studio Code from the Start menu, desktop shortcut (if created), or by searching for "Visual Studio Code" in the Windows search bar.
Configuration and Extensions:

Upon launching Visual Studio Code, you can customize the editor settings and install extensions for different programming languages and functionalities. Use Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X to open the Extensions view and search for extensions to install.

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.

User Settings:

Open VS Code and go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Ctrl+,).
Customize settings such as font size, theme, indentation preferences (tabSize, insertSpaces), and line wrapping (editor.wordWrap).
Extensions:

VS Code's power lies in its extensive extension ecosystem. Install extensions via the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
Recommended extensions:
GitLens: Enhances Git integration with features like blame annotations, file history, and more.
Bracket Pair Colorizer: Colorizes brackets and braces to improve code readability.
ESLint or Pylint: For linting JavaScript/TypeScript or Python respectively, to maintain code quality.
Live Server: Provides a live development server for web development projects.

Choose a theme that suits your preference (workbench.colorTheme in settings). Popular themes include "Dark+ (default dark)", "Light+ (default light)", and community themes like "Material Theme", "Dracula", etc.
Keybindings:

Customize keyboard shortcuts (File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts or Ctrl+K Ctrl+S) to match your workflow. You can also import keybindings from popular editors like Visual Studio or Sublime Text.
File Association:

Define file associations (files.associations in settings) to specify which extensions are associated with which languages or file types.
Integrated Terminal:

Configure the integrated terminal (terminal.integrated.shell.* settings) to use your preferred shell (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash).
Workspace Settings:

Override user settings for specific projects using workspace settings (File > Preferences > Settings > Workspace Settings).
Optional Enhancements:
Snippets: Create and manage code snippets (userSnippet in settings) to quickly insert commonly used code patterns.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
*nstall Required Extensions (if necessary):

If you're debugging a specific language or framework (e.g., Node.js, Python), ensure you have the necessary debugging extension installed from the VS Code Marketplace.
Open Your Project in VS Code:

Launch VS Code and open the folder or workspace containing your project files (File > Open Folder...).
Create or Open the Program File:

Navigate to the file containing the code you want to debug. Ensure it's opened in the editor.
Set Breakpoints:

Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. Breakpoints pause program execution at that line.
You can also set conditional breakpoints by right-clicking on a breakpoint and adding conditions.
Configure Launch Configuration:

VS Code uses launch configurations to know how to start your program for debugging. Create a launch.json file if one doesn't exist already.
Use the Run view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D) and click on the gear icon to create a launch.json file, or manually create one in the .vscode folder.
Select Debug Configuration:

Open launch.json and choose a debug configuration appropriate for your project (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java).
Configure any necessary settings such as program entry points, environment variables, etc.
Start Debugging:

Press F5 or click on the Start Debugging button (Play icon) in the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D).
VS Code launches your program in debug mode, and execution stops at the breakpoints you've set.
Debugging Controls:

Use controls in the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D) to step through code (F10 for step over, F11 for step into, Shift+F11 for step out), continue execution (F5), and stop debugging (Shift+F5).
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Variable Inspection:

View the values of variables and expressions in the Debug view and inline while stepping through code.
Watch Expressions:

Add expressions to watch their values change in real-time as you debug.
Call Stack:

See the chain of function calls that led to the current point of execution.
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines or conditions in your code.
Debug Console:

Interact with your program during debugging sessions using the integrated Debug Console.
Conditional Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specific condition is met.
Exception Handling:

Configure VS Code to break on exceptions thrown by your program.
Multi-target Debugging:

Debug multiple processes or instances simultaneously with VS Code's multi-target debugging capabilities.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    *Open Your Project in VS Code:

Launch VS Code and open the folder or workspace containing your project (File > Open Folder...).
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`` or View > Terminal`).
Use the following commands to initialize a Git repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in your current project directory.
Stage Files for Commit:

In VS Code, open the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G) from the Activity Bar (the third icon).
You'll see a list of files with changes. Click the + button next to each file you want to stage for commit, or click the + button at the top of the list to stage all changes.
Making Commits:
Commit Staged Changes:
In the Source Control view, enter a commit message in the textbox above the list of changed files.
Press Ctrl+Enter or click the checkmark icon (✓) to commit the changes.
Alternatively, you can commit using the integrated terminal:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Create a GitHub Repository (if not already created):

Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
Note the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git).
Add Remote Repository:

In the integrated terminal in VS Code, add your GitHub repository as a remote:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Replace https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git with your actual repository URL.
Push Commits to GitHub:

Push your local commits to the remote repository (GitHub):
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
This command pushes your local main branch to the origin remote (GitHub). If you're working on a different branch, replace main with your branch name.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
